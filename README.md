# EXNAT Pilot 2

This folder contains all scripts for the online experiment which I can then adapt for the longer "offline" EEG experiment. 

I wrote the study in PsychoPy using Python and JavaScript and will upload it to Pavlovia.

EXNAT_main_blocks currently contains a block structure for the online experiment. It's work in progress. EXNAT_study contains the "frame" for the blocks I build in EXNAT_main_blocks, i.e. demographics & stuff like that. I will merge the 2 studies later.

In both parts of the experiment, I use HTML scripts for building questionnaires.
